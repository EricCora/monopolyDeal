# Decisions

Decisions and their reasons. Superseded entries stay, marked as such.

## 2026-10-31: Deck exhaustion ends the game
With no cards in the deck, the discard pile or any hand, nobody can act again. The winner is decided by complete sets, then table value, then seat order. The printed rules don't cover this; seat order keeps the result deterministic.

## 2026-10-31: Debt left over when a player can't pay carries to their next turn
When plays or cards run out during the No Mercy debt phase, the turn moves on and the debt stays. The alternative, forfeiting the debt, would let players escape it by emptying their hand.

## 2026-10-31: A property that would complete a set with two Shacks starts a new set
Each loose property may carry a Shack, but a complete set may hold only one. Refusing the play could strand the card in hand, so it starts a new physical set.

## 2026-10-31: Cards in transit when the game is won go to the discard pile
The game is over, so nobody needs them, but every card stays accounted for.

## 2026-10-31: Deck-revealing plays can't be undone; the forced draw can
Undoing Pass Go gave a free look at the deck. The start-of-turn draw stays undoable because the same cards come back and no other choice is available before it.

## 2026-10-31: Clients can't set the match seed
Deck order is hidden information. `MULTIPLAYER_ALLOW_CLIENT_SEED=true` re-enables it for test servers only.

## 2026-10-31: Lobby seats survive a dropped connection for 30 seconds
**Superseded on 2026-11-01 (see below).**

Start is blocked while a seat is inside that window, so a refresh can't lose a place in the match. It's shorter than the 90-second match window because an empty seat holds up the host. A full room can still reclaim the seat for a new player.

## 2026-10-31: Automatic rejoin depends on how the page was opened
On `/`, the app returns to a live room unless the player chose Exit. On a `/join/` link it resumes only after a refresh of the same tab, tracked in sessionStorage, because a fresh link may be for another room. Existing tests require the manual Resume in that case.

## 2026-10-31: Forget Room retires the seat at once
Forgetting a room means the player won't return, so the others shouldn't wait out the grace period. Exit Match keeps the seat and the grace period.

## 2026-10-31: Duplicate names get a suffix
A second "Ann" joins as "Ann (2)" rather than being refused, so nobody is blocked from joining.

## 2026-11-01: The production backend URL is pinned in `vercel.json`
Vercel's dashboard held a `VITE_MULTIPLAYER_API_URL` for a suspended Render service, which broke multiplayer for every player. Setting it in the build command keeps the value in the repo and overrides the dashboard. The client connects to Render directly rather than through the rewrites, because Vercel rewrites may not carry WebSockets (assumed, not tested); the server already allows any origin.

## 2026-11-01: Lobby seats are held for 90 seconds, and Start waits only 30
Sharing an invite from a phone means leaving the browser, which drops the connection, so 30 seconds could cost the host their seat. The seat now gets the full reconnect window, while Start stops waiting after 30 seconds. An absent seat is removed when the match starts.
